# K15 --Sessions Greetings (Sessions and Cookies)

Notes:
-Our error page is just in our login page, with the error as an argument that the login page takes when it is rendered. 
Observations:

- Creating a Session stores the username in a dictionary.
- Sessions stores the username until page is refreshed or flask is shut off.
- Was able to open new tabs, windows, close out of old ones, and the session still held the value of  username(Can see why cookies can be a huge cybersecurity problem)


Questions :
- What does the secret_key do?
- Unsure about "checking for request type", what exactly does this mean, what is the difference between GET and POST?
- Can we have conditionals in HTML or is it solely formatting?
