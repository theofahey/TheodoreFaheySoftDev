K08 -- Group discoveries of the command '$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero'
2021-09-30

Running the command
    `$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero`
creates a python virtual environment in your home directory. It is essentially an isolated location in which Python
code can be stored and run. The "venv" refers to "virtual environment", and once created, it contains everything needed
for configuration, including a bin folder, activate scripts, and a config file.

One of the benefits of a virtual environment is the ability to install packages to just that environment, without any
effects on the Python installed on your system as a whole. However, installing packages requires first activating the
virtual environment, accomplished by changing your directory to the virtual environment and in a terminal, entering the
command `$ source bin/activate`. This takes advantage of the files created by the original command. You can run the
command `$ deactivate` to leave the virtual environment.

Furthermore, virtual environments make it possible for different applications to use different python versions and sets
of installed packages. Overall, what is created by the command '$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero' is a very useful tool
that can make managing anything that uses Python significantly easier and neater.
