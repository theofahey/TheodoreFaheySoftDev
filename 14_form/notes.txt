-The loginpage will run normally if you just run the app in a virtual environment.
  -It will load in the login.html page even if its in the templates folder
  -It will just load the file since there are no inputs to put into the template
  -Probably because the app.route is "/"
- request.args will have items in the dictionary after you inputted stuff to the login loginpage
 -The dictionary keys will be the names of the inputs
 -If you were to run request.args(['username']) in disp_loginpage(), there will be an error
 - We use the inputs to put text into parts of the response.html file
