What to do
- Read through files using csv.DictReader()
- Table columns will depend on the columns of the csv files
- Use for loops to add each row of the csv file to the table
	- c.execute("INSERT INTO table VALUES(row[adsjklfae],row[asfj], etc.")
- DO students.csv first (simpler, no repeated values)
	- Could use Primary Key for one of the fields
- For courses.csv we can either
	- Add on each row individually
	- Have one row for each id
		- can be done with while loop?
			- i.e. while row[id] == temp?
- Test in terminal using the SELECT commands

NOTABLE
- Have to add '' to denote TEXT/strings in the string you feed execute. If there are no string around it, it will be considered a number of some sort
- newline='' can cause problems between systems. Windows and Linux have different symbols for new lines which can make this code segment problematic.
- sqlite is like java in the sense that you need to add semicolons after everything to denote line endings. But you don't have to do this when using sqlite in a python file.
- You don't have to capitalize INSERT and other terms of sqlite3, it's just the common convention.
